# HTML Form Validation Using JavaScript | Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create two HTML forms for signing in and signing up, with front-end validation using JavaScript. The goal is to showcase different input field validations, including checking for empty fields, password strength, email format, and age validation.

# Features

## _**Sign In Form**_
<br> Includes fields for username and password. Validates that both fields are not empty. 

## _**Sign Up Form**_ 
<br>
Consists of multiple fields for creating a new account, including first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password. Validates each field according to specific criteria:

- **First and last name**: Cannot be empty.
- **Email**: Must be in a valid email format.
- **Password**: Must contain at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
- **Confirm Password**: Must match the password field.
- **Age**: Must be a valid number between 18 and 100.
