# HTML Form Validation Using JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to create two HTML forms for signing in and signing up, with front-end validation using JavaScript. The goal is to showcase different input field validations, including checking for empty fields, password strength, email format, and age validation.

# Features

## _**Sign In Form**_
<br> Includes fields for username and password. Validates that both fields are not empty. 

## _** Sign Up Form**_

Consists of multiple fields for creating a new account, including first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password. Validates each field according to specific criteria:

## _** First and last name: Cannot be empty. **_

## _** Password: Must contain at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.**_
